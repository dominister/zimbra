* Merged in commits 290-294 from trunk, fixes bug #9

Summary:
--------
1. In this case...

	%test = a,b,c
	policy = def,%test,fed

groups used as policy members were incorrectly resolved into 

	def AND (!a OR !b OR !c) AND fed

this is corrected now and resolves into...
	
	def AND !(a OR b OR c) AND fed

2. Gropus can now also contain other groups
