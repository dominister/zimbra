Use prefork, we cannot guarantee how long the plugins/modules will take to run and don't want to holdup other queries

--------------

Immediate requirements:

- Accounting module, similar to Quotas but no rolling window.  (2.1)
* Limits & counters

- Whitelist/Blacklist of email addy or sending server or regex on reverse dns name  (2.1)
* This should allow an admin to whitelist a sender and bypass all future checks for a sending email addy

- Greylisting: regex   (2.1)
* Option, bypass greylisting for non-dynamic reverse DNS hosts
* Option, bypass greylisting for hosts where HELO == reverse dns

- CheckHelo Blacklisting against regex/wildcard?  (2.1)
* Select the current helo's and compare to the helo blacklist list

- Add server IP column to tables to track which server is adding/updating?  (2.1)

- option to not add timestamps to logs (we capture logs with daemontools which adds (numeric) timestamps)  (2.1)
* log_timestamp=false in options

- make the responses ("Greylisting in effect") configurable  (2.1)

- Email notification when hosts are added to whitelist/blacklist  (2.1)

* Blacklist on excessive greylist retries, ie 50 in 1 minute ... etc. (2.1)
- num triplets?
- num attempts?

- Spamtrap where the IP address get blacklisted for configurable time period per trap (2.1)

- Web interface
* BCC To in amavis plugin needs Merge option, don't overwrite fields offer merge option?


--------------

Planned Features:

* Caching (2.2)

* IPv6

- ability to disable tcp connection logs while keeping action=* logs (perhaps move the latter from info to notice?)
