Use prefork, we cannot guarantee how long the plugins/modules will take to run and don't want to holdup other queries

--------------

Immediate requirements:

- ability to disable tcp connection logs while keeping action=* logs (perhaps move the latter from info to notice?)

- option to not add timestamps to logs (we capture logs with daemontools which adds (numeric) timestamps)
* log_timestamp=false in options

- make the responses ("Greylisting in effect") configurable

- Web interface
* BCC To in amavis plugin needs Merge option, don't overwrite fields offer merge option?


--------------

* Blacklist on excessive greylist retries, ie 50 in 1 minute ... etc.
- num triplets?
- num attempts?

* Email notify on whitelist/blacklist

* Accounting module, limits & counters

* Caching

* Spamtrap where the IP address get blacklisted for configurable time
period per trap

* Sender blacklisting
 
* Sender Whitelisting

* DNS name whitelisting???   (resolved address wildcard)

* IPv6

* Per receipient email address whitelists & blacklists?
