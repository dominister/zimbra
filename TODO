--------------

Database abstraction layer ontop of DBI .... totally abstract SQL, something like postfix's DB layer?


We want it to be abstracted so its easy to change how queries are done, threaded, unthreaded ... whatever

getRecord?
putRecord?
delRecord?

May allow us to switch between PreFork, Multiplex ... etc easily.
